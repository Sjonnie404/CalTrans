This program fetches events from the Apple calander and adds them to the google calander.

Google API: Google offical API
Apple  API: Cronofy

First time using this product:
- Google API will promt you to authenticate and give rights to this specific API. In this version, the google Authenticator       says this is an untrusted source. This is one of the things that need to bo fixed in upcoming versions.
- Apple's own API has an error that automatically deauthenticates any account used after 2 hours. This will be used when the     API gets a fix.

Apple API workaround:
Using Cronofy. This program generates APIs for multiple calendars. The disadvantage is that you need to register and can only use it for free on a DIY level (No payment method needed). <b>I take no responsibility for any costs that Cronofy can charge you</b> if you decide to use this on a higher scale.

The programs also asks you for an acces token from the cronofy API. You will need to register for an (free) Cronofy account. This can be done <a href="https://app.cronofy.com/session/new">here</a>.

In Cronofy you need to link your Apple Calender by generating a app-specific-key from your Icloud profile. A tutorial for this can be found <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-generate-app-specific-passwords-iphone-ipad-mac">here</a>.

After adding your Apple Calendar your acces token can be found at the top of the Cronofy page.
